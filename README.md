# SyX

**Work In Progress**

SyX (for **Sy**mbolic e**X**ecutor) is a simple computer algebra system written in pure rust.


Current capabilities:
- Derivatives
- Solving for one variable and solving systems (incomplete)
- Printing expressions in LaTeX format
- Basic expression simplification

Future things:
- Better solving
- Integrals
- Better simplification and rearrangement
- More functions
- Vectors, tensors, and abstract algebras
